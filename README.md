# Bike Sharing Prediction web app

Welcome to my machine learning app where you can predict the number of bike shares based on historical data



## Objective

The purpose of thsi project is to perform data analysis for a bike sharing business, And build a machine learning web app to predict the daily number of share rides based on historical data.




## Features Describtion

- Humidity : how much humidity is there ? 

- Season_summer : is the season is winter ? [1 or 0]

- Weathersit rain : is the weather condition is rain ? [1 or 0]


## Methods used
- Exploratory data analysis

- data cleaning

- Data Pre-Processing

- Feature Engineering

- Feature Selection

- Data Visualizations

- Hypothesis Testing

- Correlation Analysis

- Regression

## Technologies Used 

- Python (Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

- Scikit-learn

- Streamlit

## Insights 

- the number of registered rides are more than casual rides.
- Registered rides use the service mainly for work commuting.
- the casual rides are more in the weekend.
- the total rides drop down in the winter.
- the rides peak is in 8am and 5pm.
- there's a weather impact on the number of rides.
- the rides peak regarding the day is in wedensday.


## Business Recommendations 

- doing intensive marketing in winter
- courage registered users to make more rides in the weekend
